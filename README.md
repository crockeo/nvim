# nvim

Experiments in [neovim](https://neovim.io/) to see if I can get away from Emacs
now that it freezes on me more than it works. Hopefully I won't bloat my neovim
config the same way I have my emacs config ðŸ™ƒ

## Installation

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.config
$ cd ~/.config
$ git clone https://github.com/crockeo/nvim
$ cd nvim

# Optional, get the latest version of nvim for fun stuff like OOTB LSP support
$ ./download_nightly.sh

$ nvim
```
